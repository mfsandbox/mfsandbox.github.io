<h2>4. Cookies and Other Data Collection Technologies</h2>
<p>When you visit our website or use our mobile applications, we collect certain Transaction Information by automated means, using technologies such as cookies, pixel tags, browser analysis tools, server logs and web beacons.</p>
 
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>When you visit our website, we place cookies on your device. Cookies are small text files that websites send to your device or other Internet-connected devices to uniquely identify your browser or to store information or settings in your browser.  Cookies allow us to recognize you when you return.  They also help us provide a customized experience and enable us to detect certain kinds of fraud.  In many cases, you can manage cookie preferences and opt-out of having cookies and other data collection technologies used by adjusting the settings on your browser.  All browsers are different, so visit the “help” section of your browser to learn about cookie preferences and other privacy settings that may be available.</p>  
        	
<h3>Flash Cookies</h3>
<p>We may use Flash Cookies (also known as Local Stored Objects) and similar technologies to personalize and enhance your online experience.  The Adobe Flash Player is an application that allows rapid development of dynamic content, such as video clips and animation.  We use Flash cookies for security purposes and to help remember settings and preferences similar to browser cookies, but these are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your web browser. To manage Flash cookies, please see Adobe’s website at http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html or visit www.adobe.com.</p>  
 
<h3>Pixel Tags and Web Beacons</h3>
<p>Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on website pages or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or click an email, the pixel tags and web beacons generate a notice of that action.  These tools allow us to measure response to our communications and improve our web pages and promotions.</p>
 
<h3>Types of Data We Collect</h3>
<p>We collect many different types of information from cookies and other technologies.  For example, we may collect information about the device you use to access our website, your operating system type, browser type, referring domain, and other system settings, as well as the language your system uses and the country and time zone where your device is located.  Our server logs also record the IP address of the device you use to connect to the Internet.  An IP address is a unique identifier that devices use to identify and communicate with each other on the Internet. We may also collect information about the website you were visiting before you came to US and the website you visit after you leave our site.</p>
<p>In many cases, the information we collect using cookies and other tools is only used in an aggregated or non-identifiable way, without any reference to Personal Information.  For example, we use information we collect about all website users to optimize our websites and to understand website traffic patterns.</p>
<p>In some cases, we do associate the information we collect using cookies and other technology with your Personal Information.  This Privacy Statement governs how we use this information when we associate it with your Personal Information.</p>
 
<h3>Third Party Advertisers and Interest-Based Ads</h3>
<p>We have relationships with Google and other third party advertising companies to deliver interest-based advertisements, targeted to you based on your demographics, brand preferences, online behavior and similar factors.  These companies may also perform tracking and reporting functions for us on this website and other websites.  These companies may place cookies on your device when you visit our website or other websites so that they can display targeted advertisements to you.  These companies do not collect Personal Information in this process, and we do not give any Personal Information to them as part of this process.  However, this Privacy Statement does not cover the collection methods or use of the information collected by these companies.</p>
<p>For more information about interest-based advertising, please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) at www.aboutads.info/consumers.  We  comply with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising as administered by the DAA.  To opt out of being targeted by some third party advertising companies, you may visit www.aboutads.info/choices.</p>
<p>We may work with third parties that use algorithms to determine if you have interacted with our services on multiple devices and to match such devices together.  We may then display interest-based advertisements to you across your devices or otherwise use the combined data for purposes under this Privacy Statement.  For example, if you exhibit certain behaviors on your desktop computer, we may serve interest-based advertisements to you on your smartphone based upon those behaviors if we have linked both of those devices to you.  If you would like to opt-out of such cross device matching, please visit the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) at www.aboutads.info/consumers.</p>
<p>While we do provide the ability to opt-out of certain targeting advertising as described in this Privacy Statement, we do not respond to “do not track” (a/k/a DNT) signals or similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers.

We may also offer automatic (or "push") notifications. We will provide push notifications only to those customers who opt-in to receive such notifications from Us. You do not have to provide location information to Us or enable push notifications to use any of our mobile apps.  If you have questions about location and notification privacy, please contact your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings.  We may also collect information from mobile applications in the same manner that we do from websites.</p>

<p>You can also limit the communications that We send to you.  To opt-out of emails, simply click the link labeled “unsubscribe” at the bottom of any email we send you.

<p>You can exercise certain choices with respect to interest-based ads as set forth above in the “Third Party Advertisers and Interest-Based Ads” section.</p>
<p>You may request that we delete your Personal Information from our active records.
